# Cavescapes
A game that uses a Monte-Calro based learning algorithm to traverse a procedurally generated world.

## Running the Game
Run MAIN.py using python 3 or above. Requires Numpy and PyGame installed.

## Overview
As said in the heading, the Agent uses a monte-carlo based learning model. 
The world is created through the use of a modified reverse backtracking algorithm. 
Playable by a human or the AI. 
- Use arrow keys to move and 
- Turn on/off the AI by clicking the button on the top
- Speed up the learning process by clicking "fast learn". This increases the framerate and removes delay between frame updates
- The "change view" button allows you to toggle between seeing the whole board and just what the AI sees (It is able to see adjacent tiles only)
- The complexity/size of the grid can be changed by editing the ```grid_size``` variable in MAIN.py (line 7)

## Future Changes
There will most likely not be any changes or updates.
